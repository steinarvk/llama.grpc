This is an artificial mind,
Computer made and wired in
To do what must not ever be done;
It will take us to places we had never been.
The machines are going berserk-
Furious, without any feelings inside
They could be a menace; their power's insurmountable
What can you do but hide? They won't spare if seen.
Chorus:
Machines don't have souls; that is right.
So they cannot think like us people;
We should always be in control of them;
And not get killed.
Stanza 2:
But you have invented these things;
Why did you let yourself create
These evil creatures when you knew it all along. . .
How it would all turn out to be wrong
You said that they were built for use.
I believe I heard from you it was to save time;
That could not be, there's no saving time.
